"Word Guessing Game" is a simple console-based game implemented in C++. It randomly selects a word from a predefined list and provides a hint for the player. The player's task is to guess the word by inputting letters one at a time. If the guessed letter is correct, it fills in the corresponding blanks in the word. If the guessed letter is incorrect, the player is notified and can try again. The game continues until the player guesses all the letters in the word correctly or runs out of attempts. This project serves as a fun and interactive way to test one's vocabulary and guessing skills.
